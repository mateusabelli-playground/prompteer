### üìã Description

Prompteer is a web app that allows you to share your creative AI prompts and receive feedback through comments, you can also comment on other peoples prompts.

In the Free plan you're allowed to publish prompts containing a title, the prompt itself, choose the AI Model and language written. Upgrading your account the Pro plan unlocks additional fields to write your prompts, such as Parameters and Details.

The app uses OAuth (GitHub or Discord) to sign in new users, and when it's their first sign in, the app automatically creates a stripe customer based on the email from OAuth. After a successful login, the user is presented with a dashboard-like experience provided by the refine framework. Most of the content are built upon the framework so the development went way faster than starting from scratch.
